Here is your **updated GitHub-ready README** for the Tableau folder with the two newly added files integrated clearly.

# 📊 Tableau Geographic Visualizations

This folder contains **Tableau workbooks and visual outputs** built for **geographic risk intelligence of Aadhaar enrolment systems across India**.

These dashboards provide the **spatial storytelling layer** of the project, transforming raw UIDAI lifecycle metrics into actionable district-level insights.

---

## 🗺 Visualizations Included

### 1️⃣ India District **Future Risk Score** Heatmap

* Choropleth map of India
* Colored by **Future Risk Score**
* Integrates lifecycle imbalance, biometric risk, maintenance overload, and trend collapse
* Enables early detection of emerging exclusion zones

---

### 2️⃣ **Lifecycle Risk Level** Map

* Categorical risk classification:

  * Healthy
  * Watchlist
  * Critical
* Separates slow-moving backlogs from structurally broken systems

---

### 3️⃣ **Primary Failure Domain** Map

* Displays dominant failure cause per district:

  * Late Enrolment
  * Silent Exclusion
  * Biometric Stress
  * Saturation Stress
  * Growth Collapse
  * **Black Hole Friction** – instant backend rejection
  * **Maintenance Debt Collapse** – update overload choking infrastructure
* Drives root-cause based intervention design

---

### 4️⃣ **Intervention Priority** Map 🆕

* Classifies districts into:

  * Immediate Intervention
  * Monitor Closely
  * Routine Monitoring
* Converts analytical risk into **field-ready operational signals**

---

### 5️⃣ **Future Risk Trend Explorer** 🆕

* Temporal Tableau view tracking district-wise movement across:

  * Friction
  * Delay
  * Efficiency collapse
* Highlights districts transitioning from *Watchlist → Critical*

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Geographic Mapping

These maps enable UIDAI to:

* Identify **where** enrolment infrastructure is failing
* Understand **why** failure is occurring (protocol vs capacity vs biometric)
* Distinguish **persistent collapse zones** from **emerging risk districts**
* Deploy **precision interventions instead of blanket policies**

---

## 🧠 Design Choices

* District-level granularity wherever available
* Red–Amber–Green executive logic
* Hover tooltips for metric interpretation
* State → District drill-down support
* Screenshots included for offline review without Tableau Desktop
