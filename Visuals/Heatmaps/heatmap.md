#  Geographic Heatmaps – UIDAI Lifecycle Risk Analysis

This folder contains **district-level geographic heatmaps of India** that visually represent enrolment lifecycle risks and intervention priorities.

These heatmaps serve as the **strategic and executive visualization layer**, enabling rapid identification of high-risk regions and the underlying causes of enrolment stress.

## 📁 Folder Contents

### 🔴 `future_risk_score.jpeg`
**Future Risk Score Heatmap**
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aayush.w8472/viz/UIDAIDashboard/FutureRiskScore?publish=yes
- Displays district-wise **composite future enrolment risk**
- Higher intensity indicates higher likelihood of future exclusion or system stress
- Derived from lifecycle imbalance, biometric risk, saturation, and trend signals

**Primary Use:**  
Early-warning detection and district prioritization

---

### 🚨 `intervention_priority.jpeg`
**Intervention Priority Heatmap**
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aayush.w8472/viz/UIDAIDashboard/InterventionPriority?publish=yes
- Categorizes districts by recommended action urgency:
  - Immediate Intervention
  - Monitor Closely
  - Routine Monitoring
- Translates analytics into **operational decision signals**

**Primary Use:**  
Resource allocation and intervention planning

---

### ⚠️ `lifecycle_risk_level.jpeg`
**Lifecycle Risk Level Heatmap**
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aayush.w8472/viz/UIDAIDashboard/LifecycleRiskLevel?publish=yes
- Categorical representation of enrolment risk:
  - Healthy
  - Watchlist
  - Critical
- Simplifies complex risk scores into **executive-ready insights**

**Primary Use:**  
Senior leadership review and reporting

---

### 🧩 `primary_failure_domain.jpeg`
**Primary Failure Domain Heatmap**
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aayush.w8472/viz/UIDAIDashboard/PrimaryFailureDomain?publish=yes
- Highlights the **dominant root cause of risk** in each district:
  - Late Enrolment
  - Silent Exclusion
  - Biometric Stress
  - Saturation Stress
  - Growth Collapse

**Primary Use:**  
Targeted policy and operational interventions

## 🎯 Purpose of Geographic Heatmaps

These heatmaps allow UIDAI to:

- Instantly identify **high-risk geographic clusters**
- Distinguish **persistent vs emerging risk zones**
- Understand **why** a district is at risk, not just **where**
- Align interventions geographically rather than uniformly

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

- District-level granularity wherever possible
- Intuitive Red–Amber–Green color logic
- Consistent risk interpretation across maps
- Derived strictly from UIDAI-provided data
- No individual-level or sensitive data used
