# 📊 Power BI Dashboards – UIDAI Lifecycle Risk Analysis

This folder contains all **Power BI dashboards and visual outputs** developed as part of the **UIDAI Aadhaar Lifecycle Risk & Intervention Dashboard**.

The Power BI dashboards serve as the **core analytical and operational layer** of the project, translating processed enrolment, demographic, and biometric metrics into actionable insights.

## 📁 Folder Contents

### 🔹 Power BI Dashboard Files (`.pbix`)

These files contain the full interactive dashboards with filters, measures, and drill-downs.

- **UIDAI_Enrollments.pbix**  
  District-level enrolment analysis with age-wise composition, lifecycle health indicators, and enrolment trends.

- **UIDAI_Demographics.pbix**  
  Demographic update patterns, saturation behaviour, and structural enrolment signals across states and districts.

- **UIDAI_Biometrics.pbix**  
  Biometric update and compliance analysis, highlighting operational stress and future risk indicators.

- **UIDAI_Final_Dashboard.pbix**  
  Integrated executive dashboard combining enrolment, demographic, and biometric insights into a unified risk view.

> ⚠️ These files are best viewed using **Power BI Desktop**.

- **district_enrollment_profile.jpeg**  
  Visual snapshot of district-wise enrolment volume and age composition.

- **monthly_biometric_profile.jpeg**  
  Overview of biometric activity trends and system load patterns.

- **state_demographic_profile.jpeg**  
  State-level demographic enrolment and saturation insights.

## 🎯 Purpose of Power BI Dashboards

The Power BI layer enables UIDAI to:

- Monitor enrolment lifecycle health at district level  
- Detect delayed enrolment and silent exclusion patterns  
- Identify saturation and infrastructure stress  
- Support operational and policy-level decision-making  

The dashboards are **explainable**, **interactive**, and aligned with public-sector governance requirements.

## 🧠 Design Principles Followed

- Explainable, rule-based analytics (no black-box ML)
- Red–Amber–Green risk signalling
- District and state drill-down capability
- Consistent metric definitions across dashboards
- Separation of analysis and presentation layers
